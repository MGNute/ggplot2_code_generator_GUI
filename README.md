# ggplot2_code_generator_GUI
A GUI using wxPython that automatically generates code to plot with R and ggplot2

------------------------------

*Status*: Not Operational Yet. I have most of the GUI panel and dialogs built out using wxFormBuilder, but still have a few left to do. 

Major TODOs:
 - Finish buildling scale panels and dialogs
 - Connect events for all controls
 - write python to parse everything and assemble the R-code
